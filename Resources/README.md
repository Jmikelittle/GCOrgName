# Resources Folder Overview

There are a lot of important files and scripts in this folder.

`Manual org ID link.csv` is how all organizations are assigned an orgID. When new organizations are created, it's important to give them a new number that's never been used before, and include their legal name in English and in French (but for the purposes of this scripting, English is the most necessary piece here).
Please note that the correct legal name needs to be used, and is manually entered. It is not automatically sourced from the Financial Administration Action, however the FAA is available in the scraping folder. 

Below is an auto-generated summary of the files and scripts in this folder, along with an explanation of how the scripts interact with one another.

# Actions to Complete

**Update workflow, in order**
1. retrieve_datasets.py
(Probably not necessary, Receiver General only changes annually)
2a. receiver_general.py
2b. fuzzy_match_rg_names.py
2c. Fixed_RG_names.csv - manually update the GCOrgID for any new entries that arn't linked up automatically
2d. final_RG_match.py
3. ministryDownloadMerge.py
4. manualMinistries.csv - find new ministers or title changes, then manually update the minID
5. manual pop phoenix.csv - update any changes to the HR Codes or Phoneix Codes.

## How the Scripts Interact - To be validated

### Download Latest Data:
1. Run `ministryDownload.py` to download the latest ministries data and save it to `ministries.csv`.

### Merge and Update Data:
1. Run `ministryDownloadMerge.py` to merge the data from `ministries.csv` and `manualMinistries.csv`.
2. The script checks for changes, updates fields, and maintains manual changes, IDs, and notes.
3. The merged and updated data is saved to `ministries.json` and `ministries.csv`.

### Fuzzy Matching and Updating RG Names:
1. Run `fuzzy_match_rg_names.py` to perform fuzzy matching of RG names from `receiver_general.csv` and `RGDuplicates.csv` against the legal titles in `Manual org ID link.csv`, in order to pull in GC orgIDs.
2. The matched results are saved to `matched_RG_names.csv`.
3. 

### Final Matching and Merging:
1. Run `final_RG_match.py` to standardize text, replace values based on match scores, identify new entries, and merge fields from `Fixed_RG_names.csv` to `final_RG_match.csv`.
2. The final matched results are saved to `final_RG_match.csv`.

### Manual Updates:
1. Make manual edits directly in `manualMinistries.csv` for specific titles, IDs, or notes.

This setup ensures that the latest data is always integrated with your manual changes, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date view of governmental ministries.
